# Air-Passenger-Forecasting

### In this project, I performed time series forecasting on the classic Air Passengers dataset, which records the monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.

#### Using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model with seasonal components, I was able to successfully forecast passenger counts for the year 1961. The predictions indicate a continued upward trend in air travel, consistent with historical seasonal growth patterns.

# Key insights:

### The model captured the seasonal behavior (monthly cycles) and overall trend effectively.

### Forecasted values for 1961 range from ~430K to 630K passengers per month, showing expected growth in air travel.

### Auto ARIMA was used to automatically determine the best combination of parameters (p, d, q) for the model.

## This project demonstrates how time series models can be applied to make data-driven business forecasts â€” valuable for industries such as aviation, tourism, and logistics.
